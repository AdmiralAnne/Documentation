# Personal Notes on NPM
 
 npm makes writing code Easier. (use other people's code~)

## Installing NPM

1. install Node.js (javascript runtime environment)
    * it install node and npm at the same time

How to install packages

```bash
    npm install {package_name}
```

for example: (global installation)
```bash
    npm install -g gulp-cli
```

2. how to keep track of Packages ?
    * use a package json file !
```bash
    npm init -y
```

__you can always edit the json file later~__

3. versioning and updating in NPM
```bash
npm install chalk@5 (to update to version 5)
```
